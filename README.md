# Diagram-as-code
This command line interface (CLI) tool enables drawing infrastructure diagrams for Amazon Web Services through YAML code. It facilitates diagram-as-code without relying on image libraries.

The CLI tool promotes code reuse, testing, integration, and automating the diagramming process. It allows managing diagrams with Git by writing human-readable YAML.

## Getting started

### for Gopher (go 1.21 or higher)
```
$ go install github.com/awslabs/diagram-as-code/cmd/awsdac@latest
```

### for macOS user
In preparing.

## Usage

```
awsdac <input filename> [flags]

Flags:
      --cfn-template    [beta] Create diagram from CloudFormation template
  -h, --help            help for awsdac
  -o, --output string   Output file name (default "output.png")
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose logging
      --yaml            [beta] Generate YAML file from CloudFormation template
```

### Example

```
$ awsdac examples/alb-ec2.yaml
```

```
$ awsdac privatelink.yaml -o custom-output.png
```

Example templates are [here](examples).

### [Beta] Create a diagram from CloudFormation template

`--cfn-template` option allows you to generate diagrams from CloudFormation templates, providing a visual representation of the resources.
The tool can generate diagrams even if the CloudFormation template is not in a perfect format, enabling you to visualize the resources before actually creating the CloudFormation stack. This means you don't have to strictly adhere to the CloudFormation syntax constraints.

> **NOTE:** The functionality of generating diagrams from CloudFormation templates is currently in beta. It sometimes works correctly, but we are aware of several known issues where the tool might not produce accurate results. We are actively working on improving the tool and fixing these issues.

```
$ awsdac examples/vpc-subnet-ec2-cfn.yaml --cfn-template
```

There are some patterns where the tool may not work as expected. You can find a list of known issues and their status on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/awslabs/diagram-as-code/labels/cfn-template%20feature).
Your feedback and issue reports are appreciated, as they will help enhance the tool's performance and accuracy.

#### Use "--yaml" option

```
$ awsdac examples/vpc-subnet-ec2-cfn.yaml --cfn-template --yaml
```
CloudFormation templates have various dependencies, and there is no simple parent-child relationship between resources. As a result, generating the desired diagram directly from the existing CloudFormation template formats can be challenging at this stage.
We considered utilizing Metadata or comments within the CloudFormation templates to include additional information. However, this approach would make the templates excessively long, and CloudFormation templates are primarily intended for resource creation and management rather than diagram generation. Additionally, combining different lifecycle components into a single CloudFormation template could make it difficult to manage and maintain.

Therefore, instead of directly generating diagrams from CloudFormation templates, you can create a separate YAML file from CloudFormation template and customize this YAML file.
This customized YAML file can then be used as input for `awsdac` to generate the desired architecture diagrams. By decoupling the diagram generation process from the CloudFormation template structure, this approach offers greater flexibility and customization while leveraging the specialized strengths of `awsdac`.
```
CloudFormation template --[awsdac]--> yaml template --[user custom]--> your desired diagram :)
```

## Features
